# Manual Verification Plan

Care Finder Aotearoa is entering a limited public soft launch. This plan lists
the manual checks needed before broader public promotion.

## Verification Goals

- Confirm phone, email, website, address, service type, cost, eligibility, and
  current availability.
- Confirm whether the provider is taking new clients, referrals, enrolments, or
  has a waitlist.
- Confirm whether support tags are accurate: Maori, Pasifika, Asian, Rainbow,
  trauma-informed, telehealth, youth, addiction, male/female provider, and
  funded/low-cost.
- Move any provider that is not taking clients into
  `data/monitors/provider-availability-watchlist.json`.
- Update `providers.json` with a new `lastVerified` month only after a real
  source review, phone call, email reply, or provider-owned page review.
