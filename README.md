## Soft Launch Status

Care Finder Aotearoa is in limited public soft launch / pilot status. Provider
details can change, and users should confirm cost, eligibility, availability,
and contact details directly with the service before relying on them.

Report incorrect phone, website, address, eligibility, cost, or availability
information by emailing
[john@johnfinnerty.co.nz](mailto:john@johnfinnerty.co.nz?subject=Care%20Finder%20provider%20correction).

Care Finder Aotearoa helps someone take a first step when they need support but
do not know who to contact or what to say. It combines a guided intake flow,
local provider search, funding guidance, and a concise first-contact message
builder.

This project was built by [John Finnerty](https://johnfinnerty.co.nz), a
software developer based in Christchurch, New Zealand.

## Safety

This is not an emergency service or a replacement for clinical care.

If someone is unsafe right now, call **111**. If they can stay safe but need to
talk now, free call or text **1737** any time, 24/7.

The public trust pages are:

- [Privacy](privacy.html)
- [Terms and disclaimer](terms.html)
- [Data sources and corrections](data-sources.html)
- [Crisis guidance](crisis.html)

## What It Does

- Guides people through age, street address or suburb, gender, support preferences, concerns, and
  barriers to care.
- Includes NZ-only address autocomplete with a local fallback for common towns
  and suburbs.
- Uses the street address or suburb to weight nearby providers.
- Shows a care path only after the guide questions are complete.
- Recommends three first-contact options based on nearby providers, need, support
  preference, barriers, and provider fit.
- Helps users find providers by address/suburb match, support need, cost barrier, and contact
  type.
- Prioritises direct-contact providers over directory-only results.
- Generates a short, editable first-contact message.
- Provides working `mailto:` and `tel:` actions where provider contact details
  are available.
- Includes NZ funding pathways such as WINZ counselling support, Access and
  Choice, and ACC Sensitive Claims.
- Keeps user answers in the browser instead of requiring an account.

## Why This Exists

Finding mental health support can be hard when someone is overwhelmed, worried
about cost, unsure what kind of provider fits, or unable to explain what is
happening. This project tries to make the first contact smaller, clearer, and
less intimidating.

It is a navigation aid, not a diagnosis, emergency service, or replacement for
professional care.

## Provider Data

Provider records live in `providers.json`.

The database is intended to contain current, public, professional contact
details only. Direct care records should include at least one usable contact
method such as phone, email, text, or an official website/contact page.
Provider coordinates can be stored as `lat` and `lon` for distance ranking.
Each provider should also have `confidence`, `sourceQuality`, `lastVerified`,
`needsManualVerification`, `needScope`, `availabilityStatus`,
`availabilityCheckedAt`, `availabilitySource`, and
`availabilityNeedsManualReview` so launch risk, narrow-service scope, and
availability freshness are visible. Psychiatry records also carry
`requiresReferral`, `referralType`, `referralSourceUrl`,
`referralSourceExcerpt`, `referralConfidence`, `referralLastChecked`, and
`referralNeedsManualReview` so GP-referral pathways are not presented as simple
direct-contact steps.

Address lookup for users is done in the browser and is only used to rank nearby
providers. If a user chooses address lookup, the address text is sent to the
OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding service.

See `PROVIDER_DATABASE.md` for field definitions, source guidance, and import
rules.
See `DATA_QUALITY.md` for the verification checklist and public-data safety
rules.
See `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md` for soft-launch phone/email verification
priorities, blocked-by-site links requiring human review, and call scripts.

## Data Quality Tools

Refresh the database from approved exports and live opt-in sources:

```sh
node tools/refresh-provider-database.mjs
```

The refresh pipeline reads `provider-sources.json`, imports any approved GP,
FHIR, direct-care, MCNZ, Psychologists Board, and NZCCP source files that are
present, refreshes opt-in RANZCP psychiatrists, geocodes public provider
addresses, imports the curated gap-verified provider set, and writes a report to
`data/reports/provider-refresh-report.json`.
The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/provider-data-audit.yml` runs the
deterministic checks on pull requests, then runs the live refresh/recheck steps
weekly or by manual dispatch. It refreshes DoctorPricer GP clinic listings at a
conservative rate and can use `HEALTHPOINT_API_URL` / `HEALTHPOINT_API_TOKEN`
repository secrets if approved API access is granted.

Refresh the GP clinic database from DoctorPricer directly:

```sh
node tools/import-doctorpricer-gps.mjs providers.json --rate-limit-ms 5000
```

That importer queries regional seed points, dedupes clinics, filters obvious
urgent-care / student-only / non-GP records, and stores actual GP practices with
phone, website, address, and coordinates where available. Healthpoint-approved
FHIR or HPI access should still be treated as the preferred official long-term
source when it becomes available.

Export a focused queue for GP records that still depend on third-party or
DoctorPricer discovery and need stronger practice-owned or official
corroboration:

```sh
npm run export:gp-corroboration
```

This writes `data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.json`,
`data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.csv`, and
`GP_SOURCE_CORROBORATION_QUEUE.md`. The queue is review-only: it suggests
practice/Healthpoint/PHO/HPI/FHIR checks, rejects search snippets or
DoctorPricer alone as evidence, and does not update `providers.json`.

After Google Places or source-enrichment runs, export a ranked GP review pack:

```sh
npm run export:gp-review-pack
```

To let the pack fetch a small number of public Healthpoint/practice pages and
prefill short reviewer excerpts, run a bounded source-capture batch:

```sh
npm run export:gp-review-pack -- --fetch-sources --max-source-fetches 10 --rate-limit-ms 1000
```

This writes `data/gp-corroboration-review-pack.json`,
`data/gp-corroboration-review-pack.csv`, and
`GP_CORROBORATION_REVIEW_PACK.md`. It matches GP source-corroboration tasks to
Places/Healthpoint/practice-site leads, separates ready source-capture items
from conflicts and source-lookup gaps, and pre-fills draft contact fields for
the auditor. It is still review-only: a human must open the source, capture a
short excerpt or confirm the prefilled excerpt, and apply changes through
reviewed decision JSON. Automated source snippets are review aids only; they do
not prove availability, enrolment, mental-health scope, cultural support,
funding, or accepting-new-patients status.

Export source-fit evidence capture for unsupported tag, support-preference, or
telehealth findings:

```sh
npm run export:source-fit-capture -- --limit 30 --rate-limit-ms 1000
```

For repeated bounded passes, skip rows already captured and keep the earlier
review items in the output:

```sh
npm run export:source-fit-capture -- --limit 30 --skip-existing --merge-existing --rate-limit-ms 1000
```

This writes `data/provider-source-fit-evidence-capture.json`,
`data/provider-source-fit-evidence-capture.csv`, and
`PROVIDER_SOURCE_FIT_EVIDENCE_CAPTURE.md`. It fetches a bounded set of public
source pages, captures short excerpts when a flagged claim is supported, and
creates review-gated safe-removal candidates when a reachable source does not
support a broad/sensitive tag or telehealth flag. It never updates live provider
data; the auditor must confirm excerpts or corrections before `apply:review`.
`--skip-existing` prevents re-fetching the same provider/rule/target row, while
`--merge-existing` preserves previous excerpts and appends the new batch.

Export regional review priorities:

```sh
npm run export:regional-quality
```

This writes `data/regional-data-quality-report.json` and
`REGIONAL_DATA_QUALITY_REPORT.md`. It combines local provider coverage, weak GP
source tasks, source-fit findings, availability/referral/watchlist signals, and
address or coordinate gaps into region-by-region actions. The report is
triage-only and never updates live provider data.

Discover likely provider/business candidates from Google Places:

```sh
npm run discover:places -- --no-network
```

With an approved local API key, run a small bounded batch:

```sh
npm run discover:places -- --api-key-file "path/to/google-places-api-key.txt" --region Northland --type psychologist --limit-queries 2 --max-results-per-query 5
```

This writes `data/discovery/google-places-provider-candidates.json`,
`data/discovery/google-places-provider-candidates.csv`, and
`GOOGLE_PLACES_PROVIDER_CANDIDATES.md`. The API key is read locally and is not
stored in outputs. Google Places is used only as discovery/corroboration: it can
suggest likely practices, phone numbers, websites, and addresses, but it is not
enough by itself to publish clinical scope, availability, referral pathway,
telehealth, cost, or cultural/support-preference claims. Candidates feed the
auditor queue and still require stronger source evidence before live data
changes.

For repeat targeted runs, add `--merge-existing` so new Places leads are merged
into the current candidate file instead of replacing earlier candidates.

To use Places as a review-gated helper for weak GP source records, run a small
batch from the GP corroboration queue:

```sh
npm run discover:places -- --gp-corroboration-queue data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.json --region Northland --limit-queries 5 --max-results-per-query 3 --merge-existing
```

This creates exact-practice Places candidates tied back to the queued GP
provider IDs. They still need practice-owned, Healthpoint, PHO/HPI/FHIR, or
other stronger evidence before any provider row is updated.

Places candidates are also included in `npm run discover:seeds`, so the normal
evidence pipeline can use their provider-owned websites as review-gated
corroboration leads. To fetch only known seed websites, without search-engine
API calls, use a small bounded run:

```sh
npm run discover:enrich -- --fetch-seed-sources --max-seed-sources 10 --limit 10
```

This skips Google Maps/search/social URLs, respects source blocks, and still
only writes candidates and evidence for review.

Import backend-only doctor register data after approved MCNZ access:

```sh
node tools/import-mcnz-register.mjs data/imports/mcnz-register.csv
```

Import backend-only Psychologists Board verification data:

```sh
node tools/import-psychologists-board-register.mjs data/imports/psychologists-board-register.csv
```

Check provider contact quality:

```sh
npm run validate:data
npm run audit:source-fit
npm run audit:availability
npm run audit:referrals
npm run audit:quality
node tools/audit-support-preferences.mjs
node tools/audit-address-coverage.mjs
```

`tools/audit-provider-source-fit.mjs` compares each record's tags, type,
need scope, telehealth flags, cultural-support tags, and direct-contact status
against the public source fields stored in the record. It writes
`data/provider-source-fit-audit.json` and `PROVIDER_SOURCE_FIT_AUDIT.md`.
Unallowlisted high-severity findings fail CI. Temporary exceptions must be
documented in `data/provider-source-fit-allowlist.json` with a reason,
reviewer, review date, and expiry date.

Run the automated data and simulated workflow tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Audit and cautiously recheck provider availability:

```sh
node tools/find-unavailable-providers.mjs
node tools/audit-availability-watchlist.mjs
node tools/audit-provider-availability.mjs
node tools/recheck-provider-availability.mjs
npm run export:monitor
```

The watchlist lives at `data/monitors/provider-availability-watchlist.json`.
These records are not shown as live first-contact options until their page stops
matching unavailable wording and is manually reviewed. The availability audit
writes `data/provider-availability-audit.json` and
`AVAILABILITY_RECHECK_REPORT.md`. The cautious live recheck writes
`data/provider-availability-recheck-results.json`; it does not overwrite
provider records. `npm run export:monitor` turns those automated findings into
`data/provider-monitor-queue.json`, `data/provider-monitor-queue.csv`, and
`PROVIDER_MONITOR_QUEUE.md` so an auditor can review changes in the same console.

Availability statuses are intentionally conservative:

- `accepting` needs explicit source evidence and gets only a small ranking boost.
- `unknown` and `not_published` stay eligible but show confirm-availability wording.
- `waitlist` is ranked lower.
- `not_accepting` and `referrals_paused` are kept out of the first three care
  cards unless there are no alternatives, and are labelled clearly.

Audit psychiatrist referral pathways:

```sh
npm run audit:referrals
```

Private psychiatrist records should not be treated as simple direct-contact
steps when the source says a referral is needed. RANZCP Your Health in Mind
records are marked GP-referral-first. Unknown referral status stays visible, but
the UI tells users to check with the GP/provider before investing energy in a
direct enquiry.

Geocode public provider addresses for distance ranking:

```sh
node tools/geocode-provider-addresses.mjs
```

Provider importers geocode newly added or updated records automatically when a
public physical address is present and `lat` / `lon` are missing. Add
`--no-geocode` to an import command when running offline or when an import source
must not be sent to OpenStreetMap Nominatim.
When a user has entered a resolved address/suburb, normal in-person GP,
counsellor, psychologist, psychiatrist, and men's-centre matches are capped at
30 km. Confirmed telehealth, national services, helplines, directories, and
public regional pathways can still appear with clear wording.

Import approved counsellor, psychologist, or psychiatrist contacts from CSV:

```sh
node tools/import-care-providers.mjs path/to/care-providers.csv
```

Import opt-in psychiatrist listings from RANZCP Your Health in Mind:

```sh
node tools/import-ranzcp-psychiatrists.mjs
```

Refresh TalkingPoint public psychology practice listings:

```sh
node tools/import-talkingpoint.mjs
```

Refresh Mindwell online psychologist profiles:

```sh
node tools/import-mindwell-psychologists.mjs
```

Refresh the curated Google/Bing/Chrome gap-fill records and availability
watchlist:

```sh
node tools/import-gap-verified-providers.mjs
```

Build a repeatable provider-discovery queue from the Wikipedia populated-places
table. The default run writes every populated place plus Google/Bing search URLs
for GP/doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and counsellor/therapist searches
across the first 3 result pages:

```sh
npm run discover:providers
```

Narrow a manual pass to one place:

```sh
node tools/build-provider-discovery-queue.mjs --place Whangarei
```

The script generates search queues by default rather than scraping search-result
HTML, which is unreliable and often blocked. To collect search results through
approved APIs, set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` plus `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and/or
`BING_WEB_SEARCH_KEY`, then run:

```sh
node tools/build-provider-discovery-queue.mjs --run-searches --limit-searches 100
```

Prepare a psychologist verification and public-contact research queue from an
exported New Zealand Psychologists Board register search:

```sh
node tools/prepare-psychologists-board-research.mjs path/to/psychologists-board-register.csv
```

Import approved FHIR provider bundles:

```sh
node tools/import-provider-fhir.mjs path/to/provider-bundle.json
node tools/import-practitioner-roles-fhir.mjs path/to/provider-bundle.json
```

Fetch an approved Healthpoint FHIR API/export endpoint, then import it:

```sh
HEALTHPOINT_API_URL="<approved-healthpoint-fhir-endpoint>" \
HEALTHPOINT_API_TOKEN="token-if-issued" \
node tools/fetch-healthpoint-fhir.mjs healthpoint-provider-bundle.json

node tools/import-provider-fhir.mjs healthpoint-provider-bundle.json
```

Check outbound links:

```sh
node tools/check-links.mjs
```

Some health and government sites may block automated link checks with `403`.
Those should be reviewed separately from genuinely broken links.
By default the checker samples generated DoctorPricer GP links so CI does not
hammer hundreds of practice websites. It checks provider websites that users can
open from the app; add `CHECK_PROVIDER_SOURCES=true` when you also want to test
backend verification source URLs. Run this for a full provider website audit:

```sh
CHECK_PROVIDER_LINKS=full node tools/check-links.mjs
```

Set `PROVIDER_LINK_LIMIT=300` to widen the sample.
Set `LINK_CHECK_USER_AGENT`, `LINK_CHECK_RETRIES`, or
`LINK_CHECK_CONCURRENCY` when a manual audit needs a slower or site-specific
check. The default user agent is intentionally browser-like and does not
identify itself as a link checker, because some healthcare directories block
that wording before returning a useful status.

## Provider Discovery And Enrichment

Discovery tooling is deliberately separate from the live finder. It can find,
enrich, and suggest provider records, but weak or risky data still goes through
the auditor queue before it can affect public recommendations.

Run the repeatable discovery flow:

```sh
npm run discover:seeds
node tools/enrich-provider-candidates.mjs --no-network --limit 20
npm run discover:suggest
npm run export:review
```

`discover:seeds` combines existing provider records, audit findings, review
queue items, thin-region discovery queues, Google Places candidates, and
optional manual seeds into `data/discovery/provider-discovery-seeds.json`.

`discover:enrich` supports iterative "snowball" enrichment. Round 1 builds
searches from city/type/provider names. Later rounds use discovered clinician
names, practice names, public clinic websites, addresses, phone numbers, email
domains, Healthpoint/NZCCP/RANZCP/Psychology Today titles, and public LinkedIn
role signals to generate follow-up searches. Search engines are used only via
official Google Custom Search or Bing Web Search APIs when keys are configured:

```sh
GOOGLE_API_KEY=... GOOGLE_CSE_ID=... npm run discover:enrich -- --use-google-api
BING_WEB_SEARCH_KEY=... npm run discover:enrich -- --use-bing-api
```

Without API keys, or with `--no-network`, the tool writes queues and candidate
evidence from existing seeds instead of scraping search result HTML. It does not
bypass blocked sites, login-only pages, CAPTCHA pages, LinkedIn restrictions, or
source-site embedding restrictions.

For already-known source URLs, such as provider websites found by Google Places,
`discover:enrich` can fetch a capped number of seed websites without using a
search API:

```sh
npm run discover:enrich -- --fetch-seed-sources --max-seed-sources 10 --limit 10
```

Seed-source fetching skips Google Maps, search engines, social networks, and
unsupported file types. It is only used to capture reviewable excerpts and field
evidence; it never writes directly to `providers.json`.

`discover:places` is a separate Google Places discovery aid. It reads regional
priority gaps, uses the official Places Text Search API when a local key is
provided, dedupes likely businesses against existing providers, and writes
review-gated candidates. Places results are useful for finding possible clinic
names, phone numbers, websites, addresses, and coordinates; they are not enough
to publish clinical scope, availability, referral, cost, telehealth, or
support-preference claims.

Places records keep `queryType` separate from confirmed provider `type`. A
psychiatrist search can discover useful leads, but the tool should only label a
lead as a psychiatrist when the result itself, an existing provider match, or a
stronger source supports that type. Ambiguous psychology, counselling, or generic
health results remain `unknown` for auditor review.

Outputs:

- `data/discovery/provider-candidates.json`
- `data/discovery/provider-evidence-graph.json`
- `data/discovery/provider-discovery-report.md`
- `PROVIDER_DISCOVERY_REPORT.md`
- `data/discovery/provider-suggestions.json`
- `data/discovery/provider-suggestions.csv`
- `PROVIDER_DISCOVERY_SUGGESTIONS.md`
- `data/discovery/google-places-provider-candidates.json`
- `data/discovery/google-places-provider-candidates.csv`
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_PROVIDER_CANDIDATES.md`

LinkedIn is treated as corroboration only. A public LinkedIn snippet may help
identify a clinician's current role, clinic name, city, or clinic website to
search next. It must not be the sole source for specialty, availability,
referral pathway, cultural support, or public contact claims.

Provider-owned or clinic-owned pages, Healthpoint, official registers,
professional directories, PHO/NGO pages, and public clinic websites carry more
weight. Every extracted claim keeps `sourceUrl`, `sourceType`, `excerpt`,
`confidence`, `capturedAt`, and `needsManualReview`.

Suggestions are review-gated:

- search-result snippets alone cannot create live providers
- LinkedIn-only candidates stay manual research
- conflicting addresses or contact values stay manual research
- `accepting` availability requires explicit source wording
- psychiatrist `self` referral requires explicit source wording
- cultural, telehealth, and broad need/specialty tags require evidence or
  reviewer approval

## Provider Review Workflow

Provider data changes should go through a review queue rather than direct edits
where practical:

```sh
npm run export:review
```

For field-level claim review and queue compression, run:

```sh
npm run evidence:graph
npm run evidence:score
npm run evidence:conflicts
npm run export:claims
npm run export:gp-corroboration
npm run export:source-fit-capture -- --limit 30 --skip-existing --merge-existing
npm run export:auto-resolution
npm run draft:claim-batch -- --batch-key "<batch key>" --decision needs_more_info
npm run draft:source-fit-capture -- --confirmed-human-review --reviewer "Your name" --notes "Checked source; unsupported claims should be removed."
```

This writes:

- `data/provider-evidence-graph.json`
- `data/provider-claims.json`
- `data/provider-claim-scores.json`
- `data/provider-conflicts.json`
- `data/provider-claim-review-queue.json`
- `data/provider-claim-review-queue.csv`
- `data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.json`
- `data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.csv`
- `data/provider-auto-resolution-proposals.json`
- `data/provider-auto-resolution-proposals.csv`
- `PROVIDER_EVIDENCE_GRAPH.md`
- `PROVIDER_CLAIM_REVIEW_QUEUE.md`
- `GP_SOURCE_CORROBORATION_QUEUE.md`
- `PROVIDER_CONFLICTS.md`
- `PROVIDER_AUTO_RESOLUTION_PROPOSALS.md`

The claim tools are advisory only. They split provider rows into small claims
such as public phone, website, address, availability, referral pathway, support
tags, and telehealth. Low-risk public contact/identity/location claims can be
marked `auto_accept` in the graph, but the tooling does not mutate
`providers.json`. High-risk claims stay review-gated.
`export:auto-resolution` turns the graph and claim queue into explicit
auto-deprioritization proposals for low-risk claim-review noise, plus manual
batch tasks for everything still needing judgement. It does not approve or
apply provider data changes.

The local auditor console can load `data/provider-auto-resolution-proposals.json`
from the queue selector as **Auto-resolution proposals**. This is a reviewer
planning view only: it helps hide/collapse low-risk checks and keep high-risk
claim batches visible, but provider data still changes only through exported
review decisions and the controlled apply script.

The same console can load `data/gp-source-corroboration-queue.json` as
**GP source corroboration**. Use it to confirm weak third-party GP records
against practice-owned, Healthpoint, PHO, HPI/FHIR, or official sources. It is a
review surface only and must not be used to infer availability, enrolment,
specialty, cultural support, or funding eligibility.

The console can also load `data/gp-corroboration-review-pack.json` as
**GP corroboration review pack**. This is a narrower review surface for the GP
records most likely to have a usable Healthpoint or practice-site lead. It
pre-fills only draft public contact/source fields. If the pack was exported
with `--fetch-sources`, it may also pre-fill a short source excerpt for the
auditor to check. It still requires human confirmation before any adjustment is
exported. Use the **Source capture** filter in the auditor to separate captured
snippets from blocked, failed, skipped, or not-yet-fetched source checks.

For triage, the console has a conservative filtered-batch helper. After a queue
is narrowed by batch, rule, category, search, region, type, severity,
availability, or referral status, it can save `needs_more_info` decisions for
unsaved filtered items only. It does not overwrite existing decisions and it is
not a bulk approve or bulk adjust path.

`draft:claim-batch` is a draft helper for a reviewed batch. It reads the claim
queue and writes `data/provider-claim-batch-decision-draft.json` plus
`PROVIDER_CLAIM_BATCH_DECISION_DRAFT.md`. It never edits `providers.json`.
Adjustment drafts for high-risk batches require `--confirmed-human-review`, a
reviewer, and source excerpt or notes, and currently only support removing
values from array fields such as `tags`, `needScope`, and `specialties`.

`draft:source-fit-capture` is the matching helper for
`data/provider-source-fit-evidence-capture.json`. Use it only after checking the
captured source-fit rows. It groups safe-removal candidates by provider before
drafting `adjust` decisions, so removing several unsupported tags from one
provider cannot accidentally re-add another removed tag. The helper only
removes array values or turns unsupported telehealth booleans off; it cannot add
provider capabilities.

This writes:

- `data/provider-review-queue.json`
- `data/provider-review-queue.csv`
- `PROVIDER_REVIEW_QUEUE.md`

The export merges `providers.json`, source-fit findings, availability findings,
psychiatrist referral findings, address/geocode checks, the availability
watchlist, optional identity/link reports, and discovery suggestions. By default
it is a focused queue and does not include every low-risk GP record. Use
`node tools/export-provider-review-queue.mjs --include-all` for a full dump.

Open the local prototype at `admin/index.html` after serving the repo locally.
The admin console can load the manual review queue, the claim review queue, the
GP source corroboration queue, the GP corroboration review pack,
Google Places candidates, discovery suggestions, auto-resolution proposals, or
the ongoing monitor queue. It can also load **Regional priorities** as a
planning-only view from
`data/regional-data-quality-report.json`; that view disables provider-decision
export and is used to choose the next region or queue to review. The console
lets a reviewer inspect evidence and exports review decisions. It does not
write to production data.

For future checks after the initial audit, run:

```sh
npm run monitor:providers
```

That command cautiously fetches provider/watchlist source pages, reruns the
availability audit, and exports an auditor-friendly monitor queue. Automated
fetching is advisory only: a changed page, blocked page, or possible availability
change must still be confirmed by a person before `providers.json` is changed.
The weekly GitHub Actions audit also exports the monitor queue as an artifact.

Place an exported decision file at `data/provider-review-decisions.json`, then
apply it through the controlled script:

```sh
npm run apply:review
```

Decisions are:

- `approve`
- `adjust`
- `reject`
- `move_to_watchlist`
- `duplicate`
- `needs_more_info`

`correctedFields` only accepts an allowlisted set of provider fields. The apply
script rejects unsafe fields and enforces safety rules such as no `accepting`
availability without explicit evidence, no psychiatrist `self` referral without
source evidence, and no directory-to-direct-provider conversion without a direct
provider contact source. Every applied decision appends an event to
`data/provider-review-log.jsonl`.

Reviewed discovery suggestions can add a new provider only through the same
controlled script. The decision must use `approve`, set `newProviderCandidate:
true`, include allowlisted provider fields in `correctedFields`, and include a
human-captured `sourceExcerpt` from a provider-owned, Healthpoint, official, or
professional source. Google Places seed text, search snippets, LinkedIn-only
signals, blocked pages, or silence are not enough to import a provider.

Reviewed source-fit capture removals should also go through `apply:review`.
Those drafts are conservative downgrades only: removing unsupported tags,
`needScope` values, advertised specialties, or telehealth flags. Do not use them
to approve sensitive tags, advertised specialties, telehealth, availability, or
referral pathways.

After applying decisions, run:

```sh
npm run validate:data
npm run audit:source-fit
npm run audit:availability
npm run audit:referrals
npm run audit:addresses
npm test

Source pages should be opened in a new tab from the auditor UI. Iframe previews
are optional and sandboxed because many healthcare sites block embedding. Do not
proxy source websites to bypass their restrictions.

## Provider Source Principles

- Prefer official provider pages, professional body directories, Health NZ,
  Healthpoint-approved data access, NZCCP, NZ Psychological Society, RANZCP, or
  provider-owned exports.
- Do not scrape public directories where terms prohibit automated extraction.
- Do not treat directories as direct first-contact providers.
- Keep MCNZ and Psychologists Board data backend-only unless separate public
  clinic or practice contact details have been verified.
- Do not publish private emails or personal phone numbers unless they are public
  professional contact details.
- Re-verify direct-care listings regularly.
